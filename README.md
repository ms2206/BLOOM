<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>
The Barcode Linker for Organism and Ontology Mapping (BLOOM) tool provides the user with a graphical user interface (GUI) to assess the accuracy and efficiency of universal DNA barcodes for identifying the desired taxa. The underlying pipeline of BLOOM starts with searching the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases to match sequences based on nucleotide position and primers, to return a list of barcode sequences. An NCBI BLAST search is followed to identify the sequences in the BLAST core nucleotide database, which are similar to the barcode sequence. BLOOM presents the results in a results tab and provides the user the option to create a CSV or visualise the taxonomical relationships between the similar sequence species and the original species of interest. The purpose of BLOOM was designed to be used prior to wet lab work of metabarcoding method, and to be user-friendly to install and navigate for the user.
